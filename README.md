## Election-Audit Summary
The election audit code was created using dictionaries, lists and variables. With this format, this code can easily be reused with minimal modification. The input file name, column header names and output file can all be re-named to accommodate other csv files. The dictionaries, lists and variables can all be reused as they are.
